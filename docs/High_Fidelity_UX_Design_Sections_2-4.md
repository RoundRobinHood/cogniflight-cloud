## 2. Visual Styling & Component System

### 2.1 Design System Implementation

The CogniFlight Cloud design system will be built from scratch to provide full control over the visual experience. The system will use a modular architecture with design tokens for consistent theming across all components.

The planned design system is organized into layers:
- **Core Layer**: Design tokens and baseline styles
- **Utility Layer**: Reusable styling patterns and animations
- **Component Layer**: Component-specific styles
- **Application Layer**: App-specific customizations

This architecture will support runtime theme switching and maintain consistency while allowing flexibility for future enhancements.

### 2.2 Color Scheme and Typography

**Color Palette:**

The platform employs a galaxy-inspired color scheme with professional blue tones:

- **Primary Colors**: Blue family for primary actions and accents
- **Window Controls**: Yellow (minimize), Green (maximize), Red (close)
- **Background Theme**: Deep space gradients with dark blue to black transitions
- **FATCON System**: Five-level color coding from green (safe) through yellow/orange to red (critical)

**Typography:**

The design will use system-default font stacks to ensure optimal performance and native OS integration:
- Multiple font weights for hierarchy (regular, medium, semibold, bold)
- Responsive sizing from small system text to large display elements
- Consistent spacing using an 8-point grid system

### 2.3 Reusable React Components

The planned component architecture emphasizes modularity and reusability:

**System Components:**
- **Window System**: Draggable, resizable windows with snap functionality
- **Context Menus**: Right-click menus with intelligent positioning
- **Dialog System**: Confirmation dialogs and modal overlays
- **Notifications**: Toast messages and notification center panel

**Desktop Environment:**
- **Desktop**: Main workspace with icon management
- **Taskbar**: Application launcher and system tray
- **Start Menu**: Application search and quick access
- **FATCON Widget**: Real-time fatigue monitoring display

**Applications:**
- Settings, File Explorer, Notepad (with extensible architecture for additional apps)

Components will communicate through a central context provider, enabling consistent state management and inter-component coordination.

### 2.4 Material-UI or Custom Styling

**Custom Styling Approach:**

The platform will use a fully custom styling solution without pre-built UI frameworks, enabling complete design control optimized for the desktop paradigm.

**Planned Visual Elements:**
- **Glassmorphism**: Backdrop blur effects with varying opacity levels
- **Button System**: Size variants (small, medium, large) and style variants (primary, secondary, ghost, danger)
- **Animations**: Comprehensive animation library including fades, slides, scales, and special effects
- **Accessibility**: Support for reduced motion preferences and high contrast modes

## 3. Responsive Layout Design

### 3.1 Desktop-First Approach

CogniFlight Cloud will be designed with a desktop-first strategy, prioritizing professional workstation environments where aviation operations require maximum information density and multi-window workflows.

**Target Environments:**
- Control center displays (4K+ monitors)
- Professional workstations (Full HD multi-monitor setups)
- Standard desktops (single-monitor operations)
- Compact laptops (limited screen space)
- Tablet devices (emergency access only)

This approach ensures optimal performance for the primary use case: professional aviation operations with simultaneous monitoring of multiple data streams.

### 3.2 Breakpoint Definitions

The platform will implement responsive breakpoints optimized for different display sizes:

- **Large Displays (2560px+)**: Maximum information density, 6+ items per row
- **Professional Displays (1920-2559px)**: Full feature set, 4-5 items per row
- **Standard Desktop (1280-1919px)**: Standard layouts, 3-4 items per row
- **Compact Desktop (1024-1279px)**: Condensed layouts, 2-3 items per row
- **Tablet (768-1023px)**: Simplified single-column layouts
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Authentication only, desktop features disabled

### 3.3 Flexible Grid Systems

**Responsive Content Adaptation:**

Dashboard and application layouts will automatically reflow based on available space:
- Grid-based card layouts adjust column counts
- Tables show/hide columns based on priority
- Forms switch between multi-column and single-column layouts
- Navigation elements collapse to icon-only modes when needed

**Window Management:**

The window system will provide flexible layout options:
- **Snap-to-edge tiling**: Left half, right half, or full screen
- **Manual resize**: Drag edges with minimum size constraints
- **Position memory**: Windows remember their last size and position
- **Visual feedback**: Snap indicators show available tiling zones

**Interface Scaling:**

UI elements will scale appropriately across viewport sizes:
- Typography scales for readability
- Touch targets maintain minimum sizes for accessibility
- Icons and spacing adjust with screen density
- Z-index layering ensures proper element stacking

## 4. Tool Usage & Prototyping Fidelity

### 4.1 Design Tool Proficiency

**Figma Design Environment:**

The high-fidelity mockups are created using Figma, leveraging its collaborative design capabilities:
- Component-based design system with variants
- Auto-layout for responsive component behavior
- Design tokens for consistent styling
- Prototype interactions for user flow demonstration
- Team collaboration and stakeholder reviews

The team employs an iterative design process with regular feedback sessions to refine the user experience before development begins.

### 4.2 High-Fidelity Mockups

**Design Characteristics:**

The Figma mockups demonstrate high fidelity through:

**Visual Design:**
- Detailed glassmorphism effects and transparency
- Animated background concepts and transitions
- Polished micro-interactions and hover states
- Accurate color palettes and depth rendering

**Interaction Design:**
- Clickable prototypes showing user flows
- Multiple screen states (hover, active, loading, error)
- Window management interactions demonstrated
- Form validation feedback visualized
- Navigation patterns clearly defined

**Design Completeness:**
- All major user flows documented
- Edge cases and error states designed
- Accessibility considerations incorporated
- Responsive layouts for key breakpoints
- Component variations and states mapped

### 4.3 Design Handoff Documentation

**Documentation Approach:**

The design documentation will include:

- **Component Specifications**: Detailed specs for each UI component with measurements, spacing, and behavior
- **Design Tokens**: Exportable color, spacing, typography, and effect variables
- **Style Guide**: Visual language guidelines and usage examples
- **Interaction Patterns**: Documentation of standard behaviors and animations
- **Accessibility Guidelines**: WCAG compliance notes and keyboard navigation patterns

**Figma Organization:**

- Organized pages for each application and flow
- Shared component library for consistency
- Design system documentation within Figma
- Annotated screens for developer handoff
- Prototype links for stakeholder review

This design-first approach ensures thorough planning and validation before development, reducing implementation risks and maintaining alignment between design vision and technical feasibility.
