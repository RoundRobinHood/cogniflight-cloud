## Task Delegation Strategy

### Foundation Phase
**Brian** laid the entire backend foundation, establishing the Service-Oriented Architecture and core infrastructure. **Jeremia** defined UI/UX requirements and worked closely with Brian to coordinate development efforts. **Jason** began establishing Scrum processes and team coordination.

### Core Development Phase
Development proceeded in parallel across three specialized tracks:

**Backend Track** (Brian):
- Established backend foundation with complete SOA implementation
- Built filesystem, authentication, and command system
- Developed all backend services and integration points
- Created the Terminal App for command-line interface

**Frontend Track** (Susanna & Jayden):
- Susanna focused on user/pilot/flight management applications
- Jayden concentrated on real-time dashboard and visualizations
- Both worked from Jeremia's UI/UX requirements

**ML Track** (Jeremy & Janco):
- Jeremy developed face embedding functionality
- Janco created telemetry analysis and reasoning model
- Both integrated with Brian's backend infrastructure

### Integration Phase
**Brian** ensured smooth integrations across all services:
- Connected ML engine RPC with backend commands
- Facilitated frontend WebSocket integration
- Coordinated MQTT telemetry flow through the system

**Jeremia** and **Jason** worked together to ensure all integration points met requirements and deadlines were maintained.

### Refinement Phase
Team focused on polish, bug fixes, and production readiness with **Jason** managing the backlog and **Jeremia** ensuring quality standards.

## Effective Teamwork Practices

### Communication
- **Daily Standups**: Jason facilitated standups ensuring everyone understood each other and stayed aligned
- **Technical Coordination**: Jeremia and Brian worked closely to manage team direction and technical decisions
- **Cross-Team Communication**: Jason resolved conflicts and maintained clear communication channels
